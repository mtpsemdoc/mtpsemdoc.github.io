## Welcome to the semdoc

We are a phd students from [IMAG](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/) Montpellier, France.

### This is a subtitle!

We do maths in all its states! And we know $\LaTeX$: $$\mathit{AUM}(x, y^{(j)})= z_{y^{(j)}}^{(t)} - \max_{i\neq y^{(j)}}\ z_i^{(t)}$$
And some of us like to play around with visualizations.
Try this:

```python
from turtle import *
color('green')
bgcolor('black')
speed(10)
hideturtle()
b = 0
while b < 200:
	right( b)
	forward(b * 3)
	b = b + 1
```
